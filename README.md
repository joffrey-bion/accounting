# Accounting

A set of tools for personal accounting in the Netherlands:

* a mortgage simulator that allows to precisely simulate the monthly payments
in various situations (including mortgage on new constructions, which are more complicated). 

* a calculator for income taxes

> :warning: **Work in progress** While this code covers almost every case correctly internally,
> the tool in itself cannot really be used by end users because the UI is incomplete.
> Stay tuned for updates!
